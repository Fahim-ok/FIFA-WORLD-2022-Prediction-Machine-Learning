# FIFA WORLD CUP QATAR Prediction with Machine Learning

##  This is project for learing purpose

#### Machine Learning prediction is widely used in security, marketing, operations, risk, and fraud detection.Now here my curious mind turns to the FIFA World Cup.So, after much searching and finding reliable articles & sources, I attempted to implement this (based on previous historical data, fixtures) with the Poisson Distribution Formula strategy.Based on the formula, it generates a function that predicts the outcomes of knockouts, quarters, semis, and finals.
